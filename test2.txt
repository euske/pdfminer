Introduction 
 

novaPDF Printer is a virtual printer driver for Windows 2000/XP/XP x64/2003 Server/2003 Server x64/Vista/Vista 
x64. Instead of printing on paper, it creates Adobe compatible PDF files. 
 
What is PDF? 
Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format) is a universal file format that preserves the fonts, images, graphics, and 
layout of any source document, regardless of the application, hardware and operating system used to create it. 
PDF files are compact and complete, and can be shared, viewed, and printed by anyone with free Adobe Reader® 
software (or other third party PDF readers). PDF documents are also independent of the output device on which 
they are to be displayed or printed. 
 
PDF has become the de facto standard for the electronic exchange of documents. Major corporations, government 
agencies, and educational institutions streamline their operations by replacing paper-based workflow with 
electronic exchange of information. 
 
Why use novaPDF Printer? 
novaPDF Printer converts any printable file into a PDF file. Its purpose is to enable users to exchange electronic 
documents easily, independently of the environment in which they were initially created. It also helps companies 
to publish reports, marketing plans, price lists, contracts, and any other documents in a portable electronic 
document format. 
 
How to use novaPDF? 
All you have to do is to click Print from the application displaying the document and choose the novaPDF to create 
PDF files. You can generate high-quality and searchable PDF files from any Windows application. 
 
You can choose a default folder and file name for generated PDF files, or you can set them at each print job. You 
can also choose different options for the output PDF file, including custom paper size, resolution, portrait and 
landscape orientation, scale, image compression, font embedding, PDF security and document metadata. 
 
To create a PDF file you only need a windows application that can print (like Notepad or WordPad). 
To view PDF files, you need the FREE Adobe Acrobat Reader® (you can download it from www.adobe.com) or any 
other PDF viewer application.
